              unsolicited commercial emails, because we hate spam as much as you

            <p className="text-md">
              GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates
              how EU residents&apos; data is protected by companies and enhances
              the control the EU residents have, over their personal data.
            </p>
            <p className="text-md">
              The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not
              just the EU-based businesses and EU residents. Our customers’ data
              is important irrespective of where they are located, which is why
              we have implemented GDPR controls as our baseline standard for all
              our operations worldwide.

              What is personal data?
            </h3>

            <p className="text-md">
              Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual.
              GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on
              its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to
              identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person’s name or
              email address. Some examples include financial information,
              political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses,
              physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.
            </p>
            <p className="text-md">
              The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:

            <p className="text-md">
              GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should
              protect individuals&apos; personal data that they collect and
              process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing
              enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these
              facts it&apos;s simply the right thing to do. At Funtravia we
              strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and we
              already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go
